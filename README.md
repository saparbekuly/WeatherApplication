# Weather App
The Weather App is a simple Android application that provides weather information for different cities around the world. The app allows users to search for cities, view weather details, and save their favorite locations for quick access.

## Description
This Android app is developed using Jetpack Compose, integrating contemporary libraries and frameworks to elevate the user experience. It utilizes Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations and Koin for dependency injection, ensuring streamlined code management. The app adopts the MVVM architecture, enhanced with StateFlow and ViewModel for robust UI data handling, Room for persistent data storage, and Retrofit for efficient network communication
